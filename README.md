# CopyToRiverscapesFormat
This program was written to copy over FHM (Fish Habitat Model) projects from the CHaMP folder structure to the Riverscapes folder structure. With significant modification, this program can serve as the foundation for reformatting other datasets, but it was not written with that purpose in mind, and the peculiar needs of this project lead to us making decisions in the code that will not make sense in most cases. 

In short, repurposing this code for other projects may be a significant undertaking. If you want clarifications on the code, or have further questions, you can email:
